Code Generator using OpenAI Language Model
This Python script utilizes the OpenAI language model to dynamically generate code snippets based on user-provided inputs for programming language and function explanation.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
An OpenAI API key.
Installation of required Python packages check requirement.txt file.


Create a .env file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key in the following format:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Usage
Run the generate_code.py script:
python generate_code.py
Follow the prompts to input the programming language and explain the function you want to generate code for.
The script will generate code based on your inputs and print it to the console.


Example
Suppose you want to generate Python code for a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Here's how you would use the script:

Enter the programming language... Python
Explain the function... Calculate the factorial of a given number.
The script will then generate Python code for calculating the factorial of a number and print it to the console.

Limitations
The quality of the generated code may vary depending on the complexity of the task and the specificity of the input.
The script relies on the accuracy and capabilities of the underlying OpenAI language model.
